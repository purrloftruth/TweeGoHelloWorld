# netlify-build.sh
#
# This script builds a Twine game with TweeGo on Netlify.
#
# Place netlify-build.sh at the base of your project's repository.
#
# This script assumes that you keep all your .tw sources in a discrete folder in
# your repository. (Of course, TweeGo allows you to have subfolders within it.)
# Set input_dir to the directory name in your repository where you keep your .tw
# sources. Set your Publish Directory on Netlify to "public".
#
# Changelog:
# 1.0.1:
#   * Rewrote testing structure so it properly works on Netlify
#   * Add verbose flag to hide `go get` printouts on normal operation
#   * Properly deletes old files before building again
#
# 1.0: initial release
#
# TODO: Support other story formats (we're currently locked into SugarCube 2.)
# This can be worked around by setting TWEEGO_FORMAT as an environment variable.
# TODO: Support exporting files from an asset directory to the output directory.
# (Most projects don't require this, but some might.)
